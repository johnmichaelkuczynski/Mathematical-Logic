# ∞ Mathematical Logic

**Mathematical Logic** is a comprehensive, university-to-graduate–level **interactive mega-course**, delivered as a **self-contained, fully AI-powered app**.

It is not a reference manual.  
It is not a collection of disconnected notes.  
It is not a passive video course.

It *is* a complete mathematical logic curriculum—**formal logic, computation, set theory, model theory, and proof theory**—integrated into a single system with live tutoring, unlimited practice, and rigorous assessment.

## ✳️ Overview

Mathematical Logic unifies the core pillars of modern logic:

- symbolic reasoning  
- formal languages  
- computation  
- models and structures  
- proof systems  
- foundations of mathematics  

Students do not merely learn definitions.  
They **build structures**, **prove theorems**, **analyze models**, and **reason about computation**.

The app functions as:
- advanced textbook
- interactive lecture series
- AI tutor
- homework generator
- proof trainer
- exam system
- grader

No external materials are required.

## 🎯 What Makes It Different

- Unified treatment of logic, computation, and foundations
- Meaning-first formalism
- Proofs must actually work
- Models must actually satisfy
- Computations must actually compute

The system distinguishes:
- syntax from semantics
- proof from derivation noise
- real understanding from formal mimicry
